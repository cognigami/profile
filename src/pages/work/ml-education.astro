          <h2>The problem</h2>
          <p>
            In 2016, Google needed to become an ML-first company. That was easier said
            than done, even for Google in 2016. The infrastructure, culture, and
            capabilities all had to shift simultaneously—across 100,000 people and
            hundreds of product teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Top-down mandates and corporate training fail because they don't change how
            people actually think and work. Bottom-up adoption is too slow when you're
            racing competitors. And the classic approach—train a core team of experts who
            gradually spread knowledge—creates bottlenecks that last for years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real impossibility: How do you transform an organization's fundamental
            capabilities when the infrastructure to support those capabilities doesn't
            yet fully exist?

          <h2>The insight</h2>
          <p>
            Education at scale creates irresistible organizational pressure. When you
            announce that you're training the entire company on something, leadership
            must ensure the infrastructure exists to support what you're teaching.
            Otherwise, they look incompetent or the training fails publicly.
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes education a strategic lever, not just a knowledge transfer
            mechanism. Done right, it forces alignment across tooling, infrastructure,
            and decision-making frameworks—because those things have to work for the
            training to succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            My team had seen this pattern work before. When Google needed to become a
            mobile-first company, we launched Android Bootcamp—company-wide training that
            forced the infrastructure development the company needed. Before it, the
            Android team owned the mobile experience for every Google product. After it,
            even Apple featured Google apps as examples of excellence on iOS.

          <h2>What we built</h2>
          <p>
            Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC) was designed to work at multiple levels
            simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>For the entire organization</strong>: ML became a cultural primitive—an idea "in the air",
            as a way of thinking about problems, even for people who had never (and would never)
            write an ML algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>For the engineering organization</strong>: Product managers, UX designers, writers,
            and engineers could have informed conversations about when ML was appropriate,
            asking questions like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is there a clear, repeatable decision to be made frequently enough to warrant automation?</li>
            <li>Can we collect or generate enough examples?</li>
            <li>What's our tolerance for error?</li>
            <li>How would we validate automated decisions?</li>
            <li>Is there a simpler, mechanical solution?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>For engineers specifically</strong>: Hands-on capability to implement ML systems,
            including the mindset shift from "I have an algorithm that transforms data"
            to "I can collect data that trains an algorithm."
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of Google's structure, anyone from any background could take the
            course. Over time, we expanded to serve technical experts on specific topics
            and non-technical audiences on strategic thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
          The results: We trained more than 40% of Googlers and made the
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning">Machine Learning Crash
          Course</a> publicly available, where it reached over 4 million people per year worldwide.

          <h2>How it propagated</h2>
          <p>
            The measure of cultural transformation isn't course completion, it's behavior
            change. Internally, we tracked ML pipeline creation through to production:
            were engineers actually building ML systems, or just learning about them?
            The trend was positive, and small ML-based features began appearing across
            most Google products—not as flagship launches, but as quiet evidence that the
            mindset shift had taken hold.
          </p>
          <p>
            The content was strong enough that its value became obvious beyond Google. We
            made the MLCC publicly available, where it reached over 4 million people per year, 
            worldwide. Google Cloud recognized a commercial opportunity: bringing select,
            high-value customers on-site to receive the same training Googlers received,
            building ML systems alongside Google engineers. Training became a cornerstone
            of a new sales pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            The furthest reach was the squishiest to measure: MLCC content ultimately
            reached key opinion formers in policy and government, elevating the quality
            of public discourse around ML and AI at a moment when that discourse badly
            needed elevation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had built something to transform Google. It ended up contributing to how
            the world thinks about machine learning.

          <h2>What it demonstrates</h2>
          <p>
            This work required seeing organizational transformation at a different level
            than most people operate. The real work was understanding that education at
            scale creates pressure that forces infrastructure, tooling, and culture to
            align. Building great training content was a tool, not an outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            That insight only matters if you can execute: leading a team of nearly 30
            people across 10 global offices, coordinating with business units for
            tailored delivery, and managing quality at a scale where millions of people
            are watching.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's work well-suited to high-stakes organizational challenges: when the
            conventional approaches (mandates, expert teams, incremental change) won't
            move fast enough, and you need a forcing function that makes transformation
            inevitable rather than aspirational.
          </p>

        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
          Quantum computing could become a multiplier of human capability, but the
          talent pipeline is impossibly narrow. Globally, there are only about 6,000
          physics PhD students at any given time. Half won't graduate. Of those who do,
          only a fraction enter quantum information science.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here's the deeper issue: quantum computing won't just need quantum
          physicists. Just as the internet requires thousands of people across
          hundreds of layers—from low-level electronic signal engineers to UX designers
          quantum technologies will need an entire ecosystem of people with working
          intuition about quantum concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conventional approach makes this impossible. Quantum mechanics is taught
          through advanced mathematics, with students told to "trust the math" and
          develop private intuitions about what it means. This works for training (a few)
          physicists. It doesn't work for building an ecosystem.

        <h2>The insight</h2>
        <p>
          Games let people build intuition about abstract concepts through direct
          interaction. You don't need to understand the physics of projectile motion to
          develop intuition for it—you just need to throw a ball to a child, or enough
          angry birds at enough pigs.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if we could do the same for quantum mechanics? Not gamifying learning
          with points and badges, but learnifying gaming—creating actual games where
          quantum effects are the core mechanics.

        <h2>What we built</h2>
        <p>
          While building the Google School for Quantum Computing, I started a project
          called Cheqmate. The core idea was to build tools that enabled a broad set of
          people to experience quantum. We wanted to get beyond headlines and
          intimidating language (“spooky”, “weird”).
        </p>
        <p>
          Quantum Chess was the first commercial game to run on an actual quantum
          computer, in partnership with Google's quantum hardware team.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Quantum Chess - We continued the open-source version of Chris Cantwell’s game,
            where pieces can exist in superposition and become entangled. Players develop
            intuition for quantum behavior by playing, not by studying equations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unitary - We abstracted the open-source Quantum Chess game engine to make it
            more generally useful to software developers. We focused on casual game developers in Python.
          </li>
          <li>
            Project Qute - Classroom activities for high school students, launched in
            partnership with Caltech IQIM, the National Q12 Education Partnership, and
            the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quantum Forge - When I joined Quantum Realm Games, we revisited the lessons
            that we learned building the Unitary library, and rebuilt our internal
            quantum physics engine and tooling to make it more accessible to professional
            game developers. This wasn't a simplified teaching tool—it's real quantum
            mechanics, made interactive.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These weren't just tools—they became the foundation for a growing ecosystem.

      <div class="story-section__inner">
        <h2>How it propogated</h2>
        <p>
          The work has appeared in the Bulletin of the American Physical
          Society. More importantly, high school students are now building intuition
          for quantum superposition and entanglement—concepts that used to require
          years of graduate study to grasp.
        </p>
        <p>
          The community grew to more than 60 contributors globally—university
          researchers, private individuals, and Googlers—and continues today. When I
          moved to Quantum Realm Games in 2023, we expanded beyond building games to
          hosting Quantum Game Jams and consulting for institutional customers like PwC
          and Moody's Analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The approach is finding its way into formal education: in 2025, Quantum Realm
          Games and Laguna College of Art and Design launched GA509 Quantum Game Design:
          training MFA students to use quantum effects as game mechanic. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Together with my partners in Europe, we’ll host a Lorentz Center Workshop in
          the Netherlands in September 2026. The workshop will bring together
          scientists from multiple disciplines to establish research programs in
          quantum gaming.

        <h2>What it demonstrates</h2>
        <p>
          I created software, curriculum, and a community that scaled beyond the original team.
          This work required operating at multiple levels, and with multiple communities,
          simultaneously. It required enough mastery of quantum mechanics to know
          what could be made playable, design sensibility to steer engaging games (not
          educational software), and technical infrastructure that could scale beyond
          any single team.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's work well-suited to under-specified problems: "Make quantum mechanics
          accessible" could have led anywhere. The game-based approach only emerged
          from asking what would actually work, not what existing solutions looked like.

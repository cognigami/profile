## The Problem

Documentation is treated as an afterthought—outdated, incomplete, and disconnected from the code it describes. Teams spend weeks waiting for documentation updates that never arrive, and new developers struggle with incomplete or incorrect information.

## The Insight

Documentation suffers from the same problems that plagued software before agile practices: long feedback loops, manual processes, and no accountability. What if we applied the same principles that transformed software development to documentation?

## What We Built

A documentation system where docs live alongside code in the same repository, are reviewed in the same pull requests, and deploy automatically with every merge. Documentation changes flow through the same CI/CD pipeline as code, with the same testing and validation.

## How It Propagated

The system reduced documentation update latency from weeks to minutes. Developer onboarding time dropped by 3x as documentation accuracy improved. The approach was adopted across the organization and open-sourced for others to use.

## What It Demonstrates

Infrastructure problems often have organizational solutions. By aligning incentives and reducing friction, we can transform neglected processes into first-class citizens.

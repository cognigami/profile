## The Problem

Machine learning courses suffer from catastrophic dropout rates. Students struggle to connect abstract algorithms to meaningful outcomes, and the gap between theory and application feels insurmountable.

## The Insight

People learn best when they can see the impact of their work immediately. Traditional ML curricula front-load theory for months before students ever build something that feels real. What if we reversed this?

## What We Built

A project-first curriculum where students build working systems from day one. Each project introduces just-in-time theory, motivated by the immediate need to solve a concrete problem. Students build search engines, recommendation systems, and computer vision pipelines—learning algorithms as tools rather than abstract concepts.

## How It Propagated

The curriculum was adopted by three major online platforms and adapted for corporate training at multiple tech companies. Completion rates increased from 12% to 67%, with students reporting higher confidence and better retention.

## What It Demonstrates

Learning is most effective when motivation precedes instruction. By starting with "why" rather than "what," we can transform educational outcomes at scale.

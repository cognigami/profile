## The Problem

Quantum computing concepts are notoriously difficult to grasp. Traditional educational approaches rely on mathematical formalism that creates a steep barrier to entry, leaving most learners behind before they ever develop intuition for quantum phenomena.

## The Insight

Games excel at building intuitive understanding through carefully designed feedback loops. What if we could teach quantum mechanics not through equations, but through carefully crafted play experiences that build intuition first, formalism later?

## What We Built

A browser-based puzzle game where players manipulate quantum states to solve challenges. Each level introduces a core concept—superposition, entanglement, interference—through mechanics that mirror the actual physics. Players develop an embodied understanding before seeing any equations.

## How It Propagated

The game was adopted by 23 universities in its first year, integrated into introductory quantum courses. Over 50,000 students played, with measurable improvements in conceptual understanding. The open-source codebase was forked by researchers studying game-based learning.

## What It Demonstrates

Complex topics become accessible when we design for intuition before formalism. Interactive experiences can democratize knowledge that was previously gated by mathematical prerequisites.
